## Introduction

This repository is a collection of C++ programs I've written while learning the language. It includes practice exercises, problem-solving tasks, and various projects that help demonstrate my understanding of fundamental and advanced C++ concepts.

## Technologies Used

The following tools and technologies are used in this repository:

- **C++11/14/17/20** – Standard versions of the C++ programming language.
- **g++/clang++** – Compilers used to compile the code.
  
As I learn more, I might incorporate libraries or tools such as:

- **STL (Standard Template Library)** – For data structures and algorithms.
- **Boost** – A powerful set of libraries for advanced C++ development.
